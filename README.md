Type Script basic programs

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and 
adds optional static typing to the language. 
It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.
As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). 
Multiple options are available for transpilation. 
The default TypeScript Compiler can be used,or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
